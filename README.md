<p>Bike Rental Site was a site that I created in which users can sign up, view bikes available for rent, rent out a bike, and post their own bike up for rent.
To store bike and rental information I decided to utilize a MySQL database to create 3 tables to store this data, and used PHP for the overall input and data processing. 
The site is currently hosted at InfinityFree.
I plan to add more functionality in the future, such as integrating payment and email notification systems.</p>
